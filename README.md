<h2 s>User GitHub Finder</h2>
<p>I made this project with the purpose of exercising my ReactJs studies</p>
<p>In it, the user can search for a GitHub account, and the user can get information on the number of followers and how many accounts are following the searched account, the app also shows the repositories of the searched account, and the user can also search which repository the user wants find.</p>
